## Description

The **FAST NU Aggregate Calculator** is a test-taking system that simulates multiple subject sections, including Advanced Math, Basic Math, Intelligence, and English. It calculates scores based on the user's input, computes the aggregate score, and displays the results. This project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a modular, maintainable, and extendable structure for handling various subject sections.

## Features

- **Multiple Subject Sections**: The system supports different sections like Advanced Math, Basic Math, Intelligence, and English.
- **Dynamic Score Calculation**: Each section implements its own score calculation logic.
- **Results Display**: Once all answers are inputted, the system displays the score for each section and the overall aggregate score.
- **OOP Design**: The project is designed using Object-Oriented Programming principles for scalability and clarity.
